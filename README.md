We develop this website with machine learning techniques, every detection result is generated by machine learning algorithms. We use Flask as backend framework, and Vue.js as frontend framework. We have a demo video in this [youtube link](https://youtu.be/nzAiuw1F-tA) to show you the features and system architecture.

This project had won the best innovation award in 24th the International ICT Innovative Services Awards. 

If you are interesed in the frontend implementation, please refer to my teammate's [repository](https://github.com/ShihYun0130/fakeNews-web).
